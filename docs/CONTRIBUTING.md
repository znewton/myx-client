# Contributing to Myx
Before you contribute to *myx*, please read the following.

## Submitting an Issue
In the [issue template](https://github.com/znewton/myxx-client/blob/master/docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), there is a section for bugs and a section for new features. Delete whichever section does not pertain to your issue (i.e. when submitting a bug, delete everything below and including "New Feature").

### Be as descriptive as possible. 
When submitting a bug, the steps to reproduce is especially helpful when attempting to solve the issue. 

When submitting a feature, the template is mostly just a guideline so feel free to remove whichever sections you do not use. However, keep in mind that the better described your desired feature is, the more likely it is to be implemented. If/when submitting screen sketches, understand that they may not be exactly followed in implementation, however can be extremely helpful in fully communicating the new feature.

## Submitting a Pull Request
When naming a pull request, give a brief description of what is being changed (i.e. *Adding new settings modal*). If you do not want it reviewed quite yet, add *(WIP)* to the beginning of the title. 

In the [pull request template](https://github.com/znewton/myxx-client/blob/master/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), there are four sections. Please fill these out according to what's described below.
