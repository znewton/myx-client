This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find out more about how to use Create React App  [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Myxx (client)
This is the repository for the front-end of the *myxx* app.

Information on the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/znewton/myxx-api).

## Purpose
I made this app because I enjoy listening to music curators on [YouTube](https://youtube.com);
however, sometimes I want to listen to three or more of those curator's songs in a random playlist.
Sadly, YouTube doesn't provide this type of feature, and I am too lazy to maintain playlists.

Thus, the idea for *myxx* was born! With *myxx*, I can listen to songs from my choice of playlists
from however many curators I want in a random order.
